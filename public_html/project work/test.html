					Once you have contacted me, I will respond within 24-48 hours.

					DETAILS: Please include the date you would like to receive your order, what you would like to order, and quantity (if applicable).
					Think about flavors, frostings, fillings, toppings, decoration, theme, and any special requests or food allergies.
					If you aren't sure of these details, no worries-- we'll figure them out together.

					DELIVERY: As of now I am only delivering locally, in Ahmedabad.
